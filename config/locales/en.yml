# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
# how to use?
# There is a helper on models/setting.rb. def t(key)
# You can use it like this:
# 1. Setting.take.t('hello') if setting is not initialized (mostly not on controllers & views)
# 2. current_setting.t('hello') if setting is initialized (mostly on controllers & views)
