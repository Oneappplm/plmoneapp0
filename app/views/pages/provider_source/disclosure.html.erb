"Illegal use of drugs" refers to drugs whose possession or distribution is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 812.22. It "does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the controlled Substances Act or other provision of Federal law." The term does include, however, the unlawful use of prescription controlled substances.)</p>
