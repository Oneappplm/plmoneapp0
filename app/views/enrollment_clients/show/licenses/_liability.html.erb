                cation, rather that it has occurred recently enough to indicate the individual is actively engaged in such conduct. "Illegal use
                of drugs" refers to drugs whose possession or distribution is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §
                812.22. It "does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses
                authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provision of Federal law." The term does include, however, the unlawful
                use of prescription controlled substances.)
